                            Debt settlement, also referred to as debt negotiation or debt resolution, is when you negotiate with creditors to pay less than what you owe on your outstanding debt. This type of serviced is designed for people who cannot make required minimum payments and/or are considering bankruptcy. Debt Settlement will have a negative impact on your credit score but chances are your credit has already been tarnished at this point in the game. It may help people resolve debts relatively quickly.
