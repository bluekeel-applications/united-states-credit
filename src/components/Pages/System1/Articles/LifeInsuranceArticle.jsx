                <ContentText title='1. Financial Security for Loved Ones' text="Life insurance offers financial protection to your loved ones in the event of your untimely demise. It provides a tax-free lump sum payment, known as the death benefit, to your beneficiaries. This money can be used to replace lost income, pay off debts, cover funeral expenses, or fund your children's education." />
                <ContentText title='2. Debt and Mortgage Repayment' text='If you have outstanding debts, such as a mortgage, car loan, or credit card debt, life insurance can ensure that your loved ones are not burdened with these financial obligations after you are gone. The death benefit can be used to pay off these debts, preventing your family from facing financial hardship.' />
                <ContentText title='3. Income Replacement' text='If you are the primary breadwinner in your family, life insurance can provide a source of income replacement.
